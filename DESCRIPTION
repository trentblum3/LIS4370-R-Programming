Version: 0.1.0

Description: Three functions help to determine how many runs a team will score. CalculateStats will tell us a player's On Base percentage, Slugging percentage, and On Base Plus Slugging percentage should we have a dataset which doesn't list those.
    The CalculateRuns function will calculate the expected amount of runs the team should have scored in a given season no matter how many games have been played (so it can be used to measure a complete season or a partial season.)
    The PredictRuns function will take the average On Base Plus Slugging percentage of a team, and predict how many runs that team will score over a 162 game season, given a partial amount of games played. I.E. a team has played 30 games, how many will they score over 162 given those 30 games.
    PredictiveRuns, PredictiveOPS, and CurrentSeasonOPS aren't functions and are more experimental scripts to look for independent measurements.
